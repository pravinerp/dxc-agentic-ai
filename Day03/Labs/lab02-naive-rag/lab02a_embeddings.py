"""Lab 2 Part A - Embeddings with Amazon Titan: turn text into meaning.

Run:   python Day03\\Labs\\lab02-naive-rag\\lab02a_embeddings.py
Check: pytest Day03\\Labs\\lab02-naive-rag -k "challenge_1 or challenge_2 or challenge_3"

Complete TODO-1, TODO-2, TODO-3. Everything else is ready.

HOW TO WORK ON EACH TODO
  1. Read the WHY (what idea you are building).
  2. PREDICT the answer in the "My prediction" line, before you run anything.
  3. Fill the blanks (___) and delete the `raise NotImplementedError` line.
  4. Run the script. Was your prediction right? Write one sentence on why.

BIG IDEA: a computer cannot compare "meaning" in words. An embedding turns a
sentence into a list of numbers (a vector). Sentences with similar meaning get
similar numbers, so "find similar meaning" becomes "find nearby numbers".

    # WHY:   Titan is a model on AWS. We send it text, it sends back 512 numbers
    #        that capture the meaning. We never read the numbers; we only compare them.
    # STEPS: (1) build the request as JSON with the text, the size and normalize=True
    #            (normalize=True keeps every vector the same length, so scores are fair)
    #        (2) call client.invoke_model with the model id and that body

    #        is the angle between the arrows, ignoring how long they are.
